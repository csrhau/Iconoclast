###############################################################################

FIRESTARTER maximizes the energy consumption of 64-Bit x86 processors by
generating heavy load on the execution units as well as transferring data
between the cores and multiple levels of the memory hierarchy.

Supported microarchitectures
- Intel Nehalem
- Intel Westmere
- Intel Sandy Bridge
- Intel Ivy Bridge
- Intel Haswell
- AMD Bulldozer (experimental)

Since version 1.1 it is also possible to create alternating and repetitive
patterns of high load and idle (-l and -p parameters).

WARNING: This software REALLY comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY! Some systems cannot
handle the high load and crash due to overheating. It cannot be ruled out that
the stress test damages the hardware! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Usage: FIRESTARTER [Options]

Options:

-h         | --help             display usage information
-v         | --version          display version information
-c         | --copyright        display copyright information
-w         | --warranty         display warranty information
-q         | --quiet            disable output to stdout
-t TIMEOUT | --timeout=TIMEOUT  set timeout (seconds) after which FIRESTARTER
                                terminates itself, default: no timeout
-l LOAD    | --load=LOAD        set the percentage of high load to LOAD (%),
                                default 100, valid values: 0 <= LOAD <= 100,
                                threads will be idle in the remaining time,
                                frequency of load changes is determined by -p
-p PERIOD  | --period=PERIOD    set the interval length to PERIOD (ms),
                                default: 100, each interval contains a high
                                load and an idle phase, the percentage of
                                high load is defined by -l
-b CPULIST | --bind=CPULIST     select certain CPUs
                                CPULIST format: "x,y,z", "x-y", "x-y/step",
                                and any combination of the above

Examples:

./FIRESTARTER                    - starts FIRESTARTER without timeout
./FIRESTARTER -t 300             - starts a 5 minute run of FIRESTARTER
./FIRESTARTER -l 50 -t 600       - starts a 10 minute run of FIRESTARTER with
                                   50% high load and 50% idle time
./FIRESTARTER -l 75 -p 2000      - starts FIRESTARTER with an interval length
                                   of 2 seconds, 1.5s high load and 0.5s idle
