Reducing energy consumption is a prerequisite for future advances in computing at scale. This fact has led performance engineers to explore software-level power optimization as a potential means to reduce the energy consumed by scientific codes. Our work investigates the feasibility and potential benefits of this approach. We present a simple visual heuristic which allows energy conscious developers to decide whether to focus their efforts on runtime or power optimization. We then attempt to provide a realistic impression about how much arbitrary codes may benefit from power optimizations. Our work concludes by investigating how useful current methods are when searching for power optimizations. We find that for current hardware there is limited scope for improving energy efficiency through software power optimisation alone. \golden
